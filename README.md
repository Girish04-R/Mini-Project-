# Mini-Project-
                                   ❤💻📝 Accident Identification System Using GSM And GPS 💻📝❤
✔ Problem Statement :

     ✏ Now-a-days, it became very difficult to know that an accident has occurred and to locate the position where it has happened, also many deaths occur due to lack of prompt        medical Attention. 

     ✏ In such situation, informing to family members through mobile to rescue him for an extent. 

     ✏ The project aims at the security and safety of the bikers against road accidents, also to get proper and prompt medical attention, after meeting with an accident.


✔ Objective :


     ✏ The objective of this project is to detect accident and alert the guardian about accident and prevent life.
    
     ✏ It first detects accident and send s.m.s to the guardian about accident and then send the location to the registered mobile number.
    
     ✏ Developing the accident-related traffic management system.


 
 
✔ Proposed System : 


     ✏ The accident identification system has a GSM module , GPS module ,a LCD , ACCELEROMETER and ARDUINO UNO.
        
     ✏ When accident has occurred, the location details of vehicle is collected by the GPS module from the satellite, this information is in the form of latitude and longitude           scale.

     ✏ Thus collected information is then fed to Arduino Uno . Necessary processing is done and the information is passed to LCD and GSM module.
        
     ✏ The GSM module collects the information for Arduino uno and then transfer it to the mobile phone through the SMS which is in text format.


                         
✔ Application :


     ✏ These system will informed the accident location accurately which save causality 
    
     ✏ This project would make a motorcycle journey more protected and safer.
